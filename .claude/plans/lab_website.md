# Lab website modification plan

## Goal

Currently, the website is a personal website for myself.
Now that I'm starting a new lab, I want to modify the websites to turn it into a lab website.

The new lab is called "Yang Lab".

## Things to change

Below are the things I want to change:

- [ ] The home page should be the introduction to the lab
- [ ] Other sections, such as pubs, news, media, and tools, can stay
- [ ] News: need to change "I" to "Kaicheng"
- [ ] Need to create a standalone page for my personal introduction
- [ ] Move the things from the about page to this personal page
- [ ] The about page should only contain the information about the website
- [ ] Remove the link to "CV" and "About" from the navbar
- [ ] Need a page for the team
- [ ] Add a "Team" link to the navbar
- [ ] The team page should contains the information of the PI and the students
