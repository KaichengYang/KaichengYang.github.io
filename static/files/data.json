In our <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09353' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a> we analyze the prevalence and diffusion of links to low-credibility content about the pandemic across two major social media platforms, Twitter and Facebook. We characterize cross-platform similarities and differences in popular sources, diffusion patterns, influencers, coordination, and automation. Comparing the two platforms, we find divergence among the prevalence of popular low-credibility sources and suspicious videos. A minority of accounts and pages exert a strong influence on each platform. These misinformation \"superspreaders\" are often associated with the low-credibility sources and tend to be verified by the platforms. On both platforms, there is evidence of coordinated sharing of Infodemic content. The overt nature of this manipulation points to the need for societal-level rather than in-house mitigation strategies. However, we highlight limits imposed by inconsistent data-access policies on our capability to study harmful manipulations of information ecosystems."

We show that these vulnerabilities are amplified by abusive behaviors associated with  so-called 'follow trains' on Twitter, in which long lists of like-minded accounts are mentioned for others to follow. In our recent <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13691' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a>, we present the first systematic analysis of a large U.S. hyper-partisan train network. We observe an artificial inflation of influence: accounts heavily promoted by follow trains profit from a median six-fold increase in daily follower growth. This catalyzes the formation of highly clustered echo chambers, hierarchically organized around a dense core of active accounts. Train accounts also engage in other behaviors that violate platform policies: we find evidence of activity by inauthentic automated accounts and abnormal content deletion, as well as amplification of toxic content from low-credibility and conspiratorial sources. Some train accounts have been active for years, suggesting that platforms need to pay greater attention to this kind of abuse."

In our recent <a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820942744' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a>, we examine the perceptions of bots with partisan personas by conducting an experiment with human subjects. Our analysis reveals asymmetrical partisan-motivated reasoning, in that conservative profiles appear to be more confusing and Republican participants perform less well in the recognition task. Moreover, Republican users are more likely to confuse conservative bots with humans, whereas Democratic users are more likely to confuse conservative human users with bots."

                    "msg": "The fundamental idea of embedding a network in a metric space is rooted in the principle of proximity preservation. Nodes are mapped into points of the space with pairwise distance that reflects their proximity in the network. Popular methods employed in network embedding either rely on implicit approximations of the principle of proximity preservation or implement it by enforcing the geometry of the embedding space, thus hindering geometric properties that networks may spontaneously exhibit. In our <a href='https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.012305' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a>, we take advantage of a model-free embedding method explicitly devised for preserving pairwise proximity, and characterize the geometry emerging from the mapping of several networks, both real and synthetic. We show that the learned embedding has simple and intuitive interpretations: the distance of a node from the geometric center is representative for its closeness centrality, and the relative positions of nodes reflect the community structure of the network. Proximity can be preserved in relatively low-dimensional embedding spaces and the hidden geometry displays optimal performance in guiding greedy navigation regardless of the specific network topology."

However, across many domains, it is common to observe pervasively overlapping community structure, where most nodes belong to multiple communities, playing different roles depending on the contexts. We propose persona2vec, a graph embedding framework that efficiently learns multiple representations of nodes based on their structural contexts.
