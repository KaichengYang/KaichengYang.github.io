These misinformation \"superspreaders\" are often associated with the low-credibility sources and tend to be verified by the platforms.

We show that these vulnerabilities are amplified by abusive behaviors associated with  so-called 'follow trains' on Twitter, in which long lists of like-minded accounts are mentioned for others to follow. In our recent <a href='https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19354' target='_blank'><i class='far fa-file-pdf'></i> paper</a> <b>The Manufacture of Partisan Echo Chambers by Follow Train Abuse on Twitter</b>, we present the first systematic analysis of a large U.S. hyper-partisan train network. We observe an artificial inflation of influence: accounts heavily promoted by follow trains profit from a median six-fold increase in daily follower growth. This catalyzes the formation of highly clustered echo chambers, hierarchically organized around a dense core of active accounts. Train accounts also engage in other behaviors that violate platform policies: we find evidence of activity by inauthentic automated accounts and abnormal content deletion, as well as amplification of toxic content from low-credibility and conspiratorial sources. Some train accounts have been active for years, suggesting that platforms need to pay greater attention to this kind of abuse."},{image:"botperception",title:"Human perceptions of political bots",msg:"Bots are prevalent in online political discussion.
